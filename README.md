# SymboleoNLP Demo

This is a demo notebook that illustrates a very basic example of the functionality of the SymboleoNLP tool.

The user can enter input that is based on a controlled contract language. This input represents a refinement on a given contract obligation. The user refines the obligation using the controlled natural language, and the tool will update the corresponding Symboleo template accordingly.

To run the notebook, simply run the 'Import NLP Tools' section, which can take a minute to install. Then run all of the pre-execution code, which sets up the classes and helper functionality. Then run the code cell by cell under the 'Execution' section. Follow the prompts and enter the appropriate input to customize the sample obligation.

NOTE: This is a very basic demo that only covers a small slice of the functionality and the Symboleo specification. There is therefore no sophisticated error handling and the demo will not easily scale beyond the examples provided.
